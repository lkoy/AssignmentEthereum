## Design principles

I this project I tried to follow the SOLID principles:
- Single responsibility principle
- Openâ€“closed principle
- Liskov substitution principle
- Interface segregation principle
- Dependency inversion principle

Is because of that I choose a swift clean architecture VIPER.

</p>

I added as well a builder for scene to make simpler and clear the instantiation of each scene.
With this architecture I tried to fit the clean code principles:
- KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid.
- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.
- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It.
- Composition over inheritance.
- Favor readability.
- Practice consistency.
